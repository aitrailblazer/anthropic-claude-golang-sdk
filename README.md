# Anthropic Claude Golang SDK

Welcome to the Golang SDK for the Anthropic Claude API. This SDK allows developers to easily integrate and interact with the Anthropic Claude API to create and manage messages.

## Project Overview

The Anthropic Claude Golang SDK is designed to provide a simple and efficient way to access the Anthropic Claude API using the Go programming language. The SDK aims to streamline the process of creating messages and handling responses, making it easier for developers to build applications that leverage the capabilities of the Claude API.

## Key Features and Components

- **Message Creation:** Easily create and send messages using the Anthropic Claude API.
- **Response Handling:** Efficiently handle and process API responses.
- **Error Management:** Robust error handling to ensure smooth operation.
- **Configuration:** Simple configuration setup for API keys and endpoints.

## Technical Specifications

- **Language:** Go (Golang)
- **Dependencies:** Ensure you have Go installed on your system. The SDK may require additional Go packages, which can be managed using `go mod`.
- **API Version:** Compatible with the latest version of the Anthropic Claude API.

### System Requirements

- **Go Version:** 1.16 or higher
- **Network:** Internet connection to access the Anthropic Claude API

## Installation

To install the SDK, use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/yourusername/anthropic-claude-golang-sdk
```

## Use Cases and Scenarios

### Example: Sending a Message

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/yourusername/anthropic-claude-golang-sdk"
)

func main() {
    client := anthropic.NewClient("your-api-key")
    message := "Hello, Claude!"
    response, err := client.SendMessage(message)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Response:", response)
}
```

This example demonstrates how to send a message using the SDK and handle the response.

## Benefits and Advantages

- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies the process of interacting with the Claude API.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces development time with pre-built functions and error handling.
- **Flexibility:** Easily configurable to suit various application needs.
